# PantsZipper

A clone of macOS's Archive Utility on Windows! Simply uncompresses compressed files (`.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.bz2`), then opens the resulting directory. That's it!

## Install

Download the latest Installer from the Releases tab.

## Why

I created this program a couple years ago because I found Windows Explorer's ZIP decompression process tedious, and was in love with macOS's. Plus, Windows Explorer doesn't even recognize `.tar` or `.gz` files. Ridiculous! 

PantsZipper was kind of created on a whim, so it might crash or not work properly. Sorry about that! Maybe if you open an issue, I might get around to fixing it (or better yet, make a PR!)
